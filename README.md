# Google-IT_GitHub_lab
Lab for a Coursera Certification course series to practice what IT professionals do hands-on.
I am learning about all important aspects of being an IT pro by taking the Google Certification course bundle through Coursera. I have learned alot and having done alot of the concepts 
in the past, I am having fun re-learning the concepts, and ready to help a great company with my new skills!
